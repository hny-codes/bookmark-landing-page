## Overview

The purpose of this challenge is to build a static landing page and replicate it to the given style sheet as close as possible. This project is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/).

In addition, this project allowed me to practice incorporating [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), an end-to-end (E2E) testing framework, into my development process. 

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the newsletter form is submitted if:
  - The input field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## Built with
